Each script that begins with test_ can be run on its own. They are looped through in test_all.py. Make sure new changes to the code are added in the test scripts and new scripts are added if needed (also add the name of the script to the list in test_all.py). If the resulting error.log file from test_all.py is free of errors, then the code passes all tests and a new version can be committed.
